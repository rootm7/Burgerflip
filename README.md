# Burgerflip
CSC 124 Building Better Apps Project
This game was completed as an assignment for CSC 124 at Berea College.

This game was created to bring attention to the issue of minimum wage. It provides information on the topic upon completion of the game.

To play the game, the user taps the burgers on the grill. You are timed and must meet a minimum number of burgers "flipped" or be fired. Once you successfully meet the minimum number of flips in the allowed time, you are met with the info screen on minimum wage.
